<B>Use of the executables.</B> We are normally fine (and indeed encourage) the free use of the executables contained in this project for its intended end-users. The expected end-users are biologists or fishery scientists and their staff, as well as researchers and students investigating environmental issues. What they normally have in common is that they are all analysising images taken by remote field cameras, where the results are used for the public good.
