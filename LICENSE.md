Timelapse also includes various 3rd party software. Each specifies their license terms, although they generally allow non-commercial use as well (you are encouraged to visit those licenses below). 

<B>Use of the executables.</B> We are normally fine (and indeed encourage) the free use of the executables contained in this project for its intended end-users. The expected end-users are biologists or fishery scientists and their staff, as well as researchers and students investigating environmental issues. What they normally have in common is that they are all analysising images taken by remote field cameras, where the results are used for the public good. 

<B>Use or modification of the source material.</B> It's easiest to comply if you fork the project to your own open repository (similar to this one) and receive no monetary compensation for any changes you will make. If you would like to work directly with the current repository, contact Saul Greenberg at saul.greenberg@ucalgary.ca.

<B>Commercial use, including resale.</B> You have to get in touch with us at saul.greenberg@ucalgary.ca to arrange terms (see section 2(b)(3)). Note that some 3rd party software used by Timelapse does not allow commercial use unless a commercial license is purchased from their vendors.

### 3rd party software included in Timelapse, their web site, and license terms
